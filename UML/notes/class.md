# Detailed Class Diagram for Business Logic Layer
The business logic layer is responsible for encapsulating the business rules and processes of the application. It is the core of the application and is responsible for managing the data and the interactions between the data and the user interface. This layer ensures that the data is processed correctly and that the business rules are enforced consistently throughout the application. It typically includes services, business objects, and other components that handle the application's core functionality.
